# Python_Project-04
A Quiz Competition Generator 

In this project we are creating a quiz game and let users to answer it 
then send the results(score)back to the users through his mail id !

To create a quiz game we are using the file format called Json to store the questions and the answers !

We have to load the questions and the answers manually in the json file 
After creating a json file we are creating a program which is going to use this file to show the Q&A .

The users have to give thier email id to see thier results at the end of the game 
with the help of for loop we can run the process by the number of questions exists ,
The users can select the answer by looking the question and 
the program checking the answers after users selects one answerfor a question 
At the end of the game the total number of correct answers for total number of questions aksed is sended to the mail id of the user . 

The users can check their result score on thier email !

- This is my Fourth project and... From my mentor i've got the idea to work on this project .
